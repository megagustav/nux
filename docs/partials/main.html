		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>Natural User Experience (NUX) is an encompassing term relating to natural interactions, natural interfaces, and in general product interactions that feel automatic, intuitive, obvious, in short: natural.</p>
		<p><i>Natural User Interfaces</i> (NUI) are an established notion, and we wanted to distinguish the overall field from the interface paradigm, as natural interactions can occur in products void of technology, or in pure social interactions.</p>
		<h4>Preliminary Definition</h4>
		<p>Natural User Experience is the relationship between people and fabricated meaningful objects (simple artifacts or complex mechanical systems) defined by familiarity (expertly-learned, inherently intuitive or cultural) and tangibility. It feels easy (through affordance or experience), and replicates patterns of human behaviour or nature.</p>
		<h4>Disambiguation</h4>
		<h5>Natural User Interfaces</h5>
		<p>Natural User Interfaces (NUI) are interfaces that go beyond the traditional mouse and keyboard input of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).</p>
