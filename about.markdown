#### What is NUXI?
The Natural User Experience Institute is an organic set of people, focussed on defining naturalness in driverâ€“car interactions. The hope is that concepts and ideas in the automotive field can be applied to other industries, like consumer electronics or the maritime sector.

NUXI is motivated by the belief that interactions can be improved if they feel more natural: be it through affordances, experience or intuition. If something is perceived as familiar, it will be easier to use, and faults and flaws can be forgiven.

The institute started in 2023 at Politecnico di Milano, but members met at Brunel University in 2015. While its origins are academic, the aim is to create guidelines usable by multiple industries.

#### Who is NUXI?
For now, we are a small team, but we're always looking for recruits. All you need to do, is believe in the shared cause.
